## About Me 
Hi! I'm Rasika. I'm a 2nd year PhD student at [Indiana University, Bloomington,](https://luddy.indiana.edu/about/index.html) where I am fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Jisun An and Dr. Haewoon Kwak](https://soda-labo.github.io/). I've also had the priviledge of working closely with [Dr. Yong-Yeol Ahn](https://yongyeol.com/). 

My research focuses on decentralized socio-technical systems, with a particular interest in self-governance on social media and the dynamics of large language models (LLMs) in team settings. Broadly, I’m passionate about human-AI alignment and interaction. I explore how LLMs can be used as simulation devices to study these interactions—especially how parameters like team structure and human involvement shape outcomes.

Currently, I'm expanding my work to examine how LLMs can support content moderation and how understanding the internal workings of these models can lead to better value-aligned systems—aligned in beliefs, behaviors, and social expectations. 

Prior to starting my Ph.D., I completed a Master’s in Data Science at Indiana University. Before that, I earned a Bachelor of Technology in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from [Manipal Institute of Technology, India](https://www.manipal.edu/mit.html).

Outside of research, I enjoy reading (mostly fantasy), arranging a cappella music, and dabbling in new activities whenever I get the chance.

## Ongoing Projects 

- **LLMs in Content Moderation**  
  Exploring the ability of LLMs to moderate content on Reddit in a zero-shot setting to answer the question: "What can LLMs moderate and what can they not?"

- **Simulating Collective Time Distribution with LLMs**  
  Using LLMs as simulation devices to model and evaluate through estimatation methods how similar or different they distribute time as compared to humans. 

- **Characterizing Bluesky Self-Governance System**  
  Examining the characteristics of Bluesky's self-governance system to understand the nuances of the new growing social media platform that many are migrating to. 

- **Beneath the "seeming human-like" LLMs**
  Using mechanistic interpretability methods to see under the hood of LLMs to investigate if it embodies persona, values and beliefs they we think it does, both individually and in a group.
