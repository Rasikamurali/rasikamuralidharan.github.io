## About Me 
Hi! I'm Rasika. I'm a 2nd year PhD student at Indiana University, Bloomington, advised by the ever-wonderful Dr. Jisun An and Dr. Haewoon Kwak. I've also had the priviledge of working closely with Dr. Yong-Yeol Ahn. At SODA lab, I work on research related to decentralized socio-technical systems namely in the form on self-governance system on social media and interactions of LLMs in a team setting. I am interested largely in human-AI alignment and interaction. I mostly study this using LLMs as simulation devices, and particularly about the interaction parameter between LLMs and LLM teams and humans. In the near future, I am also exploring the use case of LLMs in moderation and the internal functioning of LLMs and how that understanding can help create better-aligned (in terms of values, beliefs and behaviors).
