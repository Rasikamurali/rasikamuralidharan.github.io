This study sought to use next-generation techniques (beyond LDA) from natural language processing to reprocess X data and automatically cluster groups of tweets into topics to differentiate between street- and brand-name data sets. We also aimed to analyze the differences in emotional valence between the 2 data sets to study the relationship between engagement on social media and sentiment.
