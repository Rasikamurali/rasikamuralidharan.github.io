The sources of a person's \emph{ikigai}---their sense of meaning and purpose in life---often change as they age. Reflecting on past and new sources of ikigai may help people renew their sense of meaning as their life circumstances shift. Building on insights from an initial Wizard-of-Oz robot prototype \cite{randall2023realizing}, we describe the design of an autonomous robot that uses a semi-structured conversation format to help older adults reflect on what gives their life meaning and purpose. The robot uses both pre-determined (scripted) and Large Language Model (LLM) generated questions to personalize conversations with older adults around themes of social interaction, planning, accomplishments, goal setting, and the recent past. We evaluated the autonomous robot with 19 older adult participants in a lab setting and at two eldercare facilities. Analysis of the older adults' conversations with the robot and their responses to an evaluative survey allowed us to identify several design considerations for an autonomous robot that can support ikigai reflection. Interweaving simple yet detailed pre-determined questions with LLM-generated follow-up questions yielded enjoyable, in-depth conversations with older adults. We also recognized the need for the robot to be able to offer relevant suggestions when participants cannot recall events and people they find meaningful. These findings aim to further refine the design of an interactive robot that can support users in their exploration of life's purpose.
