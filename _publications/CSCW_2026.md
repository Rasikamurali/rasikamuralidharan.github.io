The rise of decentralized social media platforms like Mastodon and Bluesky is highlighting the challenge of scaling self-governance and moderation. As communities grow, they face new issues that demand increasingly complex governance structures. Because moderation in these spaces is typically volunteer-driven, there is limited formal guidance on how community rules and moderation practices should evolve with growth. This study investigates how formalized rules scale with Mastodon instances by analyzing community rules across servers of varying sizes. We categorize these rules to identify key governance priorities, finding that smaller communities focus on narrower sets of topics, while larger servers maintain a more balanced coverage of a broad range of topics. In line with previous research, we find that topics about problematic content, such as ``Harassment,'' ``Hate Speech,'' and ``Illegal Content'' consistently dominate moderation rules regardless of server size, although their relative importance may decrease with server size. Our analysis of rule formalization reveals that as community size increases, rule scope expands, while linguistic diversity and readability decrease. Finally, we examine the role of internal and external factors on rule development. Our regression analysis shows that internal factors are strong predictors: community size predicts every aspect of rule formalization, and community maturity becomes a significant predictor alongside its size. By contrast, the number of cross-server interactions (federation) accounts only for the expansion of rule scope.
