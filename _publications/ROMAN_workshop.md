excerpt: '. We discuss an approach utilizing LLMs to generate dynamic user profiles by analyzing interactions between the robot and the user as a part of a larger project to develop a conversational robot that can assist older adults in recognizing and maintaining their ikigai (sense of meaning and purpose in life) by providing personalized interaction and engagement, however, achieving this level of personalization requires collecting user data based on what the user discusses during the conversation.

Semi-structured interviews are commonly used in social sciences that combine a protocol with the flexibility to follow topical trajectories as the conversation unfolds, allowing discovery, exploration, and meaning-making considering the lived experiences of the person being interviewed 
The project draws inspiration from the Japanese concept of ``ikigai'' or meaning and purpose in life \cite{garcia2017ikigai} that can be derived from personal, interpersonal, and community sources, such as hobbies, family, and volunteering \cite{randall2022finding}. Photographs have been used as a common tool to initiate conversations and elicit memories that can connect to older adults' relationships, family, and activities that bring them meaning in their lives.
Expanding on our study to develop an ikigai-based activity.
where older adults discuss personal photographs through conversations that bring out the special moments in their lives along with their interests, life stories and events, close relations, and even their ongoing experiences.
