excerpt: '. We discuss an approach utilizing LLMs to generate dynamic user profiles by analyzing interactions between the robot and the user as a part of a larger project to develop a conversational robot that can assist older adults in recognizing and maintaining their ikigai (sense of meaning and purpose in life) by providing personalized interaction and engagement, however, achieving this level of personalization requires collecting user data based on what the user discusses during the conversation.
